# Micro-ROS Electronic Speed Controller Firmware
Electronic speed controllers (ESCs) are used in robotics applications to control the speed of motors.
The most basic ESCs use a PWM signal to drive MOSFET gates that control current to motor coils in a specific sequence.
The faster the sequence goes, the faster the motor spins.
